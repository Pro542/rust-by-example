# rust by example

code for [rust by example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html)

run code by `cd`ing into a directory and doing `cargo run`. These directories are mapped to each major topic, as individual rust apps.

For each app, there's a `main.rs` that imports `mod`s that are subsections under a main topic.

Most of it is plain copy-typing the same code and comments, with additional comments to give a bit more context.
